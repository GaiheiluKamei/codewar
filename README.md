Ruby training from Codewar.

## 2024-01-12

In the days leading up to January 12, 2024, I attempted to solve three problems from [Codewar](https://www.codewars.com/)
every day. However, I discovered that some of the problems were not as easy as I has anticipated.
As a result, I often rushed to complete my daily plan, leading to a lower quality of 
understanding. Starting today, I have decided to change my approach: I will focus on solving 
one problem per day. **Consistency is key**.

## Kyu

- 1 kyu kata represent a proficient programming level. At this level kata are similar to 2 kyu but more challenging. They may include concepts such as:
  - Advanced AI/machine learning algorithms 
  - Complex interpreters and compilers 
  - Complex Mini-programs with multiple feature requirements (such as a complete markdown parser)

- 2 kyu kata represent a proficient programming level. At this level kata require a mature understanding of complex programming concepts - concepts such as:
  - Complex AI/machine learning algorithms 
  - Reverse engineering techniques 
  - Basic interpreters and compilers 
  - Basic mini-programs with multiple feature requirements (such as a basic markdown parser)

- 3 kyu kata represent a competent programming level. At this level the kata are similar to 4 kyu but are more challenging. They include tasks that may handle:
  - Computer science concepts utilizing advanced algorithms 
  - Ability to implement advanced requirements in a scalable fashion 
  - Basic AI/machine learning algorithms 
  - Detailed usage of advanced concepts such as concurrency, parallelism and cryptography

- 4 kyu kata represent a competent programming level. At this level the kata begin to take some serious thought to complete. They include tasks that may handle:
  - Computer science concepts utilizing complex algorithms 
  - Advanced design patterns 
  - Understanding intricate business requirements 
  - Advanced concepts such as concurrency, parallelism, meta programming and cryptography

- 5 kyu kata represent a novice programming level. At this level the kata are similar to 6 kyu but more challenging. It includes:
  - Complex language features that require mature OOP/Functional concepts 
  - Advanced OOP/Functional concepts 
  - Complex Design Patterns 
  - Advanced regular expression usage

- 6 kyu kata represent a novice programming level. At this level the kata will start to include more advanced algorithmic challenges and more complex language features. It includes:
  - Complex language features (closures, scopes, monads, etc)
  - Complex OOP/Functional concepts 
  - Basic Design Patterns 
  - Complex Regular Expressions

- 7 kyu kata represent a beginner programming level. At this level the kata will generally challenge users on their core language and API reference knowledge. Tasks such as:
  - Iterating arrays and returning a subset of values 
  - Basic data type manipulations 
  - Basic functional or object-oriented concepts 
  - Basic Regular Expressions

- 8 kyu kata represent a beginner level. At this level the kata is only challenging for users new to programming. This includes programming tasks such as:
  - Defining a simple function (i.e. hello world)
  - Basic variable assignments 
  - Fixing basic syntax issues 
  - Trivial algorithms such as basic if/else statements
