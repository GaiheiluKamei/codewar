Ruby training from Codewar.

## 2024-01-12

In the days leading up to January 12, 2024, I attempted to solve three problems from [Codewar](https://www.codewars.com/)
every day. However, I discovered that some of the problems were not as easy as I has anticipated.
As a result, I often rushed to complete my daily plan, leading to a lower quality of 
understanding. Starting today, I have decided to change my approach: I will focus on solving 
one problem per day. **Consistency is key**.
